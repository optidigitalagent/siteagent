# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Read the pinned local rules snapshot beside this skill
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

Use the checked-in snapshot. Runtime network fetches are forbidden so a review
cannot silently change when an upstream branch moves:

```
rules.json
```

The source commit is recorded in `rules.json` and `../skills.lock.json`.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Read `rules.json` from this skill directory
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
